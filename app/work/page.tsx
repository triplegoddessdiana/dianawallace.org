      <p>
        This site houses a single body of work composed of essays, definitions,
        and philosophical texts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work is not organized by project, medium, or chronology.
        It is organized by coherence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Individual pieces may originate elsewhere, but only those that can stand
        independently are included here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing on this site is provisional.
