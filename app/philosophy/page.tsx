      <p>
        This site treats writing as a way of orienting attention.
      </p>

      <p>The following axioms define the conceptual boundaries of the work.</p>

      <h2>Axioms</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Human agency precedes systems.</strong>
        <br />
        No system, platform, or process is assumed to be morally neutral.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Convenience carries a cost.</strong>
        <br />
        Efficiency is never treated as an unqualified good.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Attention is a moral act.</strong>
        <br />
        What is attended to shapes what is permitted to exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Work is an object, not a post.</strong>
        <br />
        Writing here is composed to stand independently of feeds, metrics, or distribution
        cycles.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Originators introduce frames.</strong>
        <br />
        Influence is measured by the creation of context, not by repetition or reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Remembrance is orientation.</strong>
        <br />
        Memory is treated as a navigational faculty, not as nostalgia.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Automation alters speech.</strong>
        <br />
        When speech is automated, meaning is redistributed.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Choice can collapse without force.</strong>
        <br />
        The absence of coercion does not imply the presence of freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Myth is a technology of meaning.</strong>
        <br />
        Narrative structures shape perception before argument does.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Silence is a signal.</strong>
        <br />
        What is not said often exerts as much influence as what is spoken.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A life may be citeable.</strong>
        <br />
        A way of living can function as a reference, not merely a subject.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The work glows anyway.</strong>
        <br />
        Value is not contingent on recognition.
      </p>

      <h2>Notes on Scope</h2>

      <p>
        These axioms are not beliefs to adopt or reject. They are constraints under which
        the work is produced.
      </p>

      <p>Individual essays may test, contradict, or refine them.</p>
