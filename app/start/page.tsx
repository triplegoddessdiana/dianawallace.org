      <h1>Start Here</h1>

      <p>
        I write about human sovereignty, memory, and meaning in an automated
        world.

      <h2>Ways of entry</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essays.</strong> Written to introduce frames—ways of seeing—
          rather than to win arguments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expect Nothing.</strong> A voice transmission: reflection,
          silence, and remembrance, spoken aloud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The books.</strong> A cohesive mythic canon meant to be lived
          with, not skimmed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The canon</h2>

      <p>This body of work unfolds across three forms:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Books — long-form, cohesive, mythic</li>
        <li>Essays — precise, citational, orienting</li>
        <li>Audio — presence, voice, transmission</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where to begin</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Five minutes:</strong> Read one short essay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Thirty minutes:</strong> Listen to one episode.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Depth:</strong> Begin with the first book.
        </li>
      </ul>
